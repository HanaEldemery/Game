# "The Last of Us: Legacy"
# Functional Game based on Object-Oriented Programming principles (using Java FX)
I undertook a comprehensive development process to create a functional game based on object-oriented programming principles: "The Last of Us: Legacy". Initially, I established the project's package hierarchy, including engine, exceptions, model.characters, model.collectibles, model.world, tests, and views. I implemented foundational interfaces and classes, such as Collectible, Vaccine, and Supply, to represent game objects.
The core of the game was built around the abstract Character class and its subclasses, Hero and Zombie, each with specific attributes and behaviors. Heroes were further specialized into Fighter, Medic, and Explorer classes, while the Zombie class tracked the number of zombies created. I also defined the Cell class and its subclasses, CharacterCell, CollectibleCell, and TrapCell, to represent different types of cells on the game map.
To manage the game logic, I developed methods for movement, attacks, special actions, and item usage, ensuring that all actions adhered to the game's rules. The Collectible interface includes methods for picking up and using collectibles. The Character class has new methods for attacking, defending, and handling character death, ensuring proper game logic for combat and removal of defeated characters. In the Hero class, I implemented methods for moving in specified directions, using special actions, and curing zombies. Additionally, I updated the Game class to include methods for starting the game, checking win and game-over conditions, and ending the turn, which handles zombie attacks, resets hero states, updates map visibility and spawns new zombies. I implemented exception handling for various invalid actions through custom exceptions like InvalidTargetException, MovementException, NoAvailableResourcesException, and NotEnoughActionsException.
In the final phase of "The Last of Us: Legacy", I successfully implemented a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java FX for the game, ensuring that all game actions and states are visually represented and interactable. The GUI was built manually without the use of automated GUI creators, following the guidelines to maintain clarity and usability throughout the gameplay. I designed the interface to reflect any actions performed within the engine immediately in the GUI and vice versa, providing a seamless experience for the player.
The GUI was designed to reflect the effects of in-game actions dynamically, providing a clear and intuitive gameplay experience. The game begins with the player selecting their starting character from the list of available heroes. Once selected, the game loads correctly, displaying the play view with all instances created. During gameplay, the player can choose which hero to take actions with, allowing for the alternation of heroes within the same turn. The GUI ensures that after every action, the game checks for win or loss conditions, notifying the player if the game has ended.
I handled all exceptions and validations for inputs or actions performed, ensuring that any exceptions thrown from the second milestone are appropriately communicated to the player without terminating the game. This involves clear notifications for the player regarding any errors or invalid actions, guiding them to make valid choices. This comprehensive approach resulted in a robust and interactive game engine that could be played seamlessly through the GUI.
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in applying object-oriented programming principles, handling complex game logic, and creating an interactive graphical user interface. This comprehensive development process not only strengthened my technical skills in Java and GUI development but also enhanced my ability to design and implement robust software systems. The successful completion of "The Last of Us: Legacy" demonstrates my capability to manage and execute multi-phase projects, ensuring high-quality and user-friendly results. This experience has prepared me well for future challenges in software development, providing a strong foundation for my growth as a developer.
